# GPS Tracker Backend System Requirements

## System Overview
- This project is a backend for a GPS tracker system
- Trackers report location info to the backend
- Mobile app reads location info from the backend
- Tracker firmware and mobile app will be separate projects
- Backend uses AWS serverless architecture with HTTP API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CDK

## Technical Architecture
- API Gateway for RESTful endpoints
- Lambda functions for business logic
- DynamoDB for data persistence
- AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- JWT for authentication

## Data Models

### Tracker Device
- Unique tracker ID
- Activation status
- Owner information
- Factory registration date
- Last reported location
- Battery level
- Firmware version

### Location Record
- Tracker ID
- Timestamp
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Battery level at time of report
- Signal strength
- TTL of 3 days

### User
- User ID
- Email
- Hashed password
- Created date
- Last login
- List of owned tracker IDs

## API Endpoints

### Device Management
- Factory registration endpoint for tracker IDs
- Endpoint to report location (secured with device authentication)
- Endpoint to check device activation status
- Endpoint to deactivate/reactivate device
- Endpoint to get tracker details

### User Management
- User registration
- User sign in (returns JWT)
- Password reset
- Email verification
- Update user profile

### Tracker Ownership
- Assign tracker to user
- Remove tracker from user
- List all trackers owned by user

### Location Data
- Get latest location of a tracker
- Get location history of a tracker

## Security Requirements
- Device authentication for tracker endpoints
- JWT-based authentication for user endpoints
- Rate limiting for all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Data encryption at rest
- HTTPS for all communications
- Access control based on tracker ownership

## Performance Requirements
- API response time < 200ms for 95% of requests
- Support for at least 1000 concurrent device connections
- Support for at least 100 location updates per second
- Support for at least 1 million location records per day

## Monitoring and Logging
- CloudWatch metrics for all Lambda functions
- API Gateway access logs
- Error tracking and alerting
- Device connection status monitoring
- Location update success rate monitoring
- User activity logging for security

## Data Retention
- Location data TTL: 3 days
- User activity logs: 90 days
- Error logs: 30 days
- Device connection logs: 7 days

## Scalability
- Auto-scaling for Lambda functions
- DynamoDB on-demand capacity
- Regional deployment capability
- Multi-region deployment ready

## Development Requirements
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Load testing scripts
- Deployment scripts for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
